        November 06 ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An Action Day for Particulates is now in
        effect for the seven-county Denver-Boulder metropolitan area. Requests to
        limit driving are now in effect until at least 4 PM Wednesday, November 6,
        2019. Light winds and stagnant conditions are expected to allow Fine Particulate
        Matter concentrations to reach levels that are Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups.
        Concentrations of fine particulates in the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
        category are are expected to be confined to locations within the Denver Metro
        area. For areas included in this advisory that are not expected to exceed
        the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG) air quality designation, we request
        that activities, such as driving, be reduced to lessen the impacts on neighboring
        air quality. Additional air pollution in this region may directly diminish
        air quality or contribute to precursors which may also adversely affect air
        quality. For Colorado air quality conditions, forecasts and advisories, visit:
